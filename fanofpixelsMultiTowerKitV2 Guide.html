				<h2 id="What">What is this thing?</h2>
				<p>fanofpixels' Multi-Tower Kit is a kit that is meant 
				to make the creation of JToH fangames easy, as this
				kit supplies the scripts nessasary to make things like
				winpads and portals actually work.</p>
				
				<i>If you are having troubles with something, feel free 
				to DM me on Discord: Ethan Pixelate#1822, though im not 
				always online.</i>
				
				<h2 id="Supported">Supported Kits and Tested Towers</h2>
				Fanofpixels' Multi-Tower Kit supports importing towers from the 
				following kits:
				<ul>
					<li>JToH Tower Creation Kit v4</li>
					<li>JToH Tower Creation Kit v5</li>
					<li>JToH Tower Creation Kit v5.1</li>
					<li>JToH Tower Creation Kit v5.2 <i>(RunRepoScript doesn't break :zomg:)</i></li>
					<li>JToH Tower Creation Kit v5.3</li>
					<li>JHT Megacollab Kit v2</li>
					<li>JToH Kit v8.3</li>
				</ul>
				
				The kit has been tested with the following publicly 
				available towers:
				<ul>
					<li><i>(Works)</i> 7_qz - Tower of Deus Ex Machina</li>
					<li><i>(Works)</i> fanofpixels - Tower of Forsaken Anemoia</li>
					<li><i>(Works)</i> fanofpixels - Maybe Eating a True Loaf of Absolute Failure</li>
					<li><i>(Works)</i> Duskpyramid - Tower of Verdant Entropy</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="52Note">A Note About v5.2</h3>
				The JToH Creation Kit v5.2 was known for constantly breaking, 
				so much so that it caused the release of v5.3. The main 
				bug was that the new script repository system introduced 
				would not always load correctly, this multi-tower kit's 
				COLoader script does not have this problem, becsuse i 
				fixed it by handling scripts differently than how the 
				kit's included LocalPartScript does it. However, the 
				beat blocks still do not work because the kit shipped 
				with numerous NumberValues missing, so if you are planning on 
				building a tower from scratch in the multi-tower kit, 
				either find what values they use, or just use 5.3.
				
				<h2 id="Setup">Setting things up</h2>
				<p>Now that you have a basic overview of this kit, its 
				time to learn how to actually use this kit. In order 
				to actually use this kit, you are going to need access 
				to the kit itself, if you got this guide pre-packaged 
				with the .rbxl file, then congrats, you already have 
				the place and can move on to either setting it up from 
				scratch, or adding it to an existing place. However, if 
				you dont have the rbxl, the original copy is uncopylocked, 
				and you are fully allowed to download a copy from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5961403949/">here</a></a>, 
				just click the 3 dots and press "Edit".</p>
				<h3 id="SetupNew">Creating a Place From Scratch</h3>
				<p>If you have decided to install the multi-tower kit 
				from scratch, then you are reading the right section. 
				To set up the kit from scratch, follow the following steps:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>First, grab a copy of the template place if you 
					have not already, then you need to publish it as your 
					own, to do that, hold <code>Alt+Shift+P</code>, and 
					the window for publishing should pop up, enter the 
					basic info, and hit publish.</li>
					<li>Now, you must make sure the actual place is 
					using R6 avatar types, to do this, go to the home 
					tab of studio, and click on the button that reads 
					"Game Settings", a window should pop up, click on 
					the Avatar tab and there should be a multiple choice 
					box for the avatar type, and make sure R6 is selected.</li>
					<li>Have fun creating the lobby! And altough it 
					actually doesn't matter, it is reccomended to keep 
					parts of the lobby itself in the <code>workspace.Lobby</code> 
					folder, as it keeps things tidy.</li>
					<li>When you want to actually import towers into the 
					realm, see <a href="StepImport">Importing a Tower</a>.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3 id="SetupExisting">Adding to an Existing Place</h3>
				<p>It is likely that you already have a place set up, 
				but you want to install the kit ontop of said place. 
				This section is dedicated to exactly that, and is a 
				fairly straightforward process. This guide assumes that 
				all towers already in the place resemble the kit, meaning 
				that the kit includes a <code>ClientSidedObjects</code> 
				folder, an <code>Obby</code> folder, a <code>Frame</code> 
				model, and a <code>SpawnLocation</code>, if the tower does 
				not have a SpawnLocation, then dont panic, it's not 
				hard to create a new one, and if you are going to make 
				a new spawn, use a <code>Part</code> instead of a <code>SpawnLocation</code>,
				this will make things easier.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Open up the template place and the existing place.</li>
					<li>Copy everything inside of the template place's
					<code>ReplicatedStorage</code>, and paste it inside 
					of the target place's <code>ReplicatedSorage</code></li>
					<li>In the target place's workspace, create 3 new 
					<code>Folder</code>s, and name them the following 
					(Case sensitive):<ul>
						<li>"Towers"</li>
						<li>"Portals"</li>
						<li>"Markers"</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>If your place already contains a <code>LocalPartScript</code>, 
					then either delete, or archive it as it will be replaced.</li>
					<li>In the template place's <code>StaterPlayerScript</code>, 
					copy the following scripts and paste them in the target place's 
					<code>StarterPlayerScripts</code>:<ul>
						<li>COLoader</li>
						<li>GameAnnouncements</li>
						<li>OldButtons</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>In the template place, copy the following scripts 
					from <code>ServerScriptService</code> and paste it 
					in the target place's <code>ServerScriptService</code>:
					<ul>
						<li>ClientObjectStorage</li>
						<li>Pads</li>
						<li>MusicModule</li>
					</ul>The MusicModule isn't mandatory, but using the 
					one inluded in the template place has an extra feature 
					that will be covered later</li>
					<li>Create a folder in <code>ServerStorage</code> and 
					name it "TowerClientObjects"</li>
					<li>Copy the <code>WinpadParticles</code> from the 
					same storage and paste it in the target place's 
					<code>ServerStorage</code></li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3 id="SetupImport">Importing a Tower</h3>
				<p>Now its time for arguably the most important part of 
				this entire kit, importing towers. If you are importing 
				an already-made tower, just import it's model into the 
				workspace and follow the steps below. If you are building 
				a tower from scratch, then import a kit (Preferably the 
				latest official JToH kit, which as im writing this is v5.3), 
				delete the "Scripts" and "Testing Stuff" models, follow 
				the steps below, and start building.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Rename the kit folder to the tower's acronym, 
					this is important as that is how it will be referenced 
					internally and what is displayed at the top of the screen.</li>
					<li>Convert the <code>SpawnLocation</code> to a normal 
					<code>Part</code>, while reserving the name "SpawnLocation", 
					either do it manually by deleting the SpawnLocation and 
					inserting a new part to take it's place, or use a plugin 
					like <a href="https://www.roblox.com/library/906681627/">Quenty's Class Converter</a>.</li>
					<li>Insert a <code>StringValue</code> into the folder 
					and name it "ProperName", and set it's value to the 
					proper, non-acronym name of the tower (E.g. "Tower of Hecc",
					 "Tower of Screen Punching", "Not Even A Tower", etc.)</li>
					<li>Insert an <code>IntValue</code> into the folder 
					and name it "BadgeID", set it's value to the ID of the 
					badge that will be rewarded if completed, if your tower
					does not reward a badge, leave it's value at 0</li>
					<li>Locate the <code>WinPad</code> in the tower's Obby folder, 
					and insert an <code>ObjectValue</code> into it. Name the 
					ObjectValue "KitFolder", and set it's value to the 
					kit folder itself.</li>
					<li>If you set up the tower correctly, then you can 
					play the game, and enter "/loadtower [acronym]" into 
					the chat (replace the "[acronym]" with whatever you renamed 
					the kit folder to), and the tower should load without problems.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4 id="SetupPortal">Creating a Portal</h4>
				<p>As you can imagine, using <code>/loadtower</code> isn't 
				the most elegant way of starting a tower, normally you would 
				walk through a portal and start playing instead of using 
				some cryptic debug command that shouldn't even be enabled 
				in the final version.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Either clone an existing portal, or insert a Part 
					into the workspace's "Portals" folder</li>
					<li>If you decided to insert a part instead of cloning 
					an existing portal, insert a <code>Stringvalue</code> 
					into the new part an name it "TowerPortal"</li>
					<li>Now whether you needed to follow step 2 or not, 
					the portal part should contain a StringValue that is 
					named "TowerPortal", set it's value to the acronym of 
					the tower it will teleport you to, for example, if i 
					had a tower which has it's kit folder named "ToH", 
					then the TowerPortals value should be "ToH".</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4 id="SetupItemBarriers">Adding Item Barriers</h4>
				<p>In the template place, there are 2 item barriers, one 
				of them is a Bootleg Coil item barrier, the other one is 
				a Vertical Mobility item barrier, functionally, both of 
				them are identical, they even share the same script, but 
				are presented as 2 different barriers for convenience. 
				To implement an item barrier, copy one of the barriers, 
				and paste it in a tower's <code>ClientSidedObjects</code> 
				folder, and transform it to whatever position, size, and 
				orientation you want, to make this barrier appear ingame, 
				there is a <code>StringValue</code> in the barrier called 
				"ItemName", set it's value to the name of the tool that 
				must be equipped to make the item barrier appear.</p>
				
				<h2 id="Config">Configurating the Kit</h2>
				Now that you have set up the kit, there may be some 
				things you would like to configure certain parts of it.
				<h3 id="ConfigDebug">Debug Mode</h3>
				Debug mode is a special mode that is enabled by default, 
				and gives you extra information over what is happening 
				behind the scenes, and grants you the following abilities:
				<ul>
					<li>the /loadtower command</li>
					<li>the /unloadtower command</li>
					<li>the /unloadall command</li>
				</ul>
				To disable/enable this mode, simply find the BoolValue 
				in <code>game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.COLoader</code> 
				called "Debug" and set its value depending on whether 
				you want it on or not.
				
				<h3 id="ConfigWinpad">Configuring the Winpads</h3>
				To adjust properties of the winpad and how it works, open 
				<code>game.ServerScriptService.Pads</code>, and on lines 
				6-11 are some variables that you are free to change. 
				What each variable does is explained by the comments in 
				that script. 
				<h3 id="ConfigGui">Reformatting the GUI</h3>
				Perhaps the default GUI does not fit your desires, thats 
				ok, if you want to change things up, its located in 
				<code>game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.COLoader.LocalGui</code>.
				The cool thing about how the kit uses the GUI, is that it 
				does not care whether the used GUI elements are directly under 
				the ScreenGui instance, meaning you can have a certain TextLabel
				buried under 50 frames, and it will still work. If you want 
				to disable a certain GUI element completely with no chance 
				of ever appearing, most of them can be deleted completely 
				without problems. Heres a following list of GUI elements 
				used by the script and the properties that will be overriden:
				<ul>
					<li><code>RestartLabel</code>, represents the giant red text that 
					reads "Restarting..." when you hold R.<ul>
						<li><code>TextTransparency</code></li>
						<li><code>TextStrokeTransparency</code></li>
					</ul></li>
					<li><code>Timer</code>, represents, well, the timer that shows 
					how long you have been playing a tower.<ul>
						<li><code>Text</code></li>
					</ul></li>
					<li><code>BoostsUsed</code>, represents the label that appears 
					if any boost item is equipped<ul>
						<li><code>Visible</code></li>
					</ul></li>
					<li><code>TowerAcronym</code>, displays the acronym of the current 
					tower being played if any.<ul>
						<li><code>Text</code></li>
					</ul></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2 id="ListOfPortals">List of Portals</h2>
				<p>In this section, you will be able to get an overview 
				of every portal included in the kit, while you dont 
				actually <i>need</i> to have portals look like any of 
				the provided portals, its still handy to know what each
				of them actually mean.</p>
				<h3 id="JToHDC">Juke's Towers of Hell Difficulty Chart</h3>
				This is the main difficulty chart standard most people
				stand by, as this is literally <i>the</i> standard set 
				of portals. It should be noted that Insane and above are
				 refferred to as the "Soul-Crushing" (or SC for short) 
				diffitulies, and they represent the pinacle of 
				difficulty available in JToH, and no SC tower within the 
				base game allows for boost items (like the Bootleg Coil).

				<h3 id="JETDC">JToH's Easiest Towers Difficulty Chart</h3>
				<p>This difficulty chart, or JET for short, is 
				an unofficial difficulty chart that contains difficulties 
				that are extremely easy, some of them are to the point 
				where you dont even need to do anything to win.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Win</li>
					<li>Unloseable</li>
					<li>Automatic</li>
					<li>Joyful</li>
					<li>Press-A-Key <i>(PAK)</i></li>
					<li>Climb-A-Truss <i>(CAT)</i></li>

					<li>Effortlessless</li>
					<li>Effortless <i>(Was originally apart of JToHDC)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>JToH's Hardest Towers Difficulty Chart</h4>
				<p>This difficulty chart, or JHT for short, is annother 
				unofficial set of difficulties that delve into the realm
				of questioning what is actually possible, with "Why" 
				difficulty being the first difficulty listed that is 
				actually humanly impossible, and requires special 
				assistance like TAS in order to be completed. However 
				this difficulty chart does have it's limits, Malicious 
				difficulty represents the absolute limit of physical 
				possibility, anything above goes into the JJTDC.</p>

				<h3 id="UDDC">Universe-Devouring Difficulty Chart</h3>
				<p>This difficulty chart is actually an extension to the 
				JHTDC by Priistone, and adds 2 new difficulties. However 
				the actual UDDC adds 5 new difficulties, but 3 of them 
				are actually borrowed from the JJTDC.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Nullifying <i>(Located in between DEATH and HELL)</i></li>
					<li>SUFFER <i>(Located in between Omega and Aleph-Null)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="JJTDC">JToH's Joke Towers Difficulty Chart</h3>
				<p>As the name would suggest, the JJTDC is an unofficial 
				difficulty chart that houses joke difficulties, and do 
				not care about following any real guidelines as to what 
				they mean, or how towers could be built to suit such 
				difficulties. There are waaay more difficulties on the 
				JJTDC than what is listed here, but to add them to the 
				kit would be a waste of time for me, and frankly i dont 
				think many people are going to chose much specific 
				difficulties that are actually on the JJTDC due to how 
				many difficulties there are, impossible or not.</p>
